# Bot563_Project

notebook-log.md -- Reproducible script which documented the whole process of analysis, including all testing, learning process, parameter testing, and all codes. It might contain notes about the learning process, so it can be messy but useful to remind me for future analysis. 

script_quality_control -- documented all codes (per sample) for quality control by using Trimmomatic v 0.39. Each code is conducted in separate folders in research drive and output files are located in the Trimmed_reads folder in research drive. 

script_getOrgenalle_CHTC -- the script that can assemble using getOrgenalle for all samples simultanouely. This is the submit script for CHTC. Although this project does not really use this script, it would be very handy to the future.  

change_tree_tip --- the R code to change tip label with R. It works fine for IQ-TREE tree file but does not work for MrBayes file, because probablity data will be lost. Tree tip labels were manually changed for MrBayes tree file. Further work needs to be done here. 

Geneious_illustration --- the folder contains some screenshot when I trimmed the assemblies by using Geneious. These screenshots will be used as illustrations for the final presentation. 

FastQC_results --- the folder containing some results from FastQC. These results are FastQC output when it was my first time to run FastQC before any trimming and analysis.
